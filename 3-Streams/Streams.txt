Streams are used to read or write sequentially.
 Basically, when we have to handle and manipulate streaming data for example continuous source or a big file, streams come in handy. 
 In node we have 4 streams:

 1) writable: used to write data sequentially
 2) readable: used to read data sequentially
 3) duplex: used to both read and write data sequentially
 4) transform: data can be modified while reading and writing
